                        Artificial Intelligence (AI): a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines
                        and computer programs that can think and learn like humans. It enables computers to perform 
                        tasks such as recognizing images, understanding speech, and making decisions, helping us solve 
                        complex problems.

                        Machine Learning (ML): a subset of Artificial Intelligence that teaches computers how to learn 
                        and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. A computer will learn from examples 
                        and data, allowing it to recognize patterns, make decisions, and make predictions.

                        purchasing patterns. Spotify and Netflix do similar things with recommending relevant media.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Supervised vs Unsupervised:
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Supervised Learning: We know both the inputs and the outputs of the data. Imagine you 
                                have a set of pictures of animals, and each picture is labeled with the name of the 
                                animal. Your goal is to teach the computer to recognize animals based on their pictures. 
                                In supervised learning, you would show the computer these labeled pictures and tell it, 
                                "This is a dog," "This is a cat," and so on. The computer learns patterns and features 
                                from these labeled examples and tries to generalize them to correctly classify new, 
                                unseen pictures. This process is similar to how a teacher guides a student by providing 
                                correct answers to study questions.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Unsupervised Learning: We only know the inputs of the data. Imagine you have a bag of 
                                mixed-up puzzle pieces, but you don't have the picture of the completed puzzle. Your 
                                goal is to figure out how the pieces fit together and form the complete picture. In 
                                unsupervised learning, the computer would try to group similar puzzle pieces based on 
                                their shapes, colors, or patterns without any knowledge of what the final picture looks 
                                like. By identifying patterns and similarities in the puzzle pieces, the computer can 
                                make intelligent guesses about how they might fit together. This process is similar to 
                                exploring and discovering patterns on your own, without any external guidance or hints.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Parametric model vs Non-parametric model:
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Parametric model: We know the shape of the modeling function. For example, the shape could
                                be linear like with the salary problem we did in class. It could also be quadratic, 
                                logarithmic, etc, as long as we know the shape of it. In short, these models can be 
                                described using a certain set of parameters.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Non-parametric model: Non-parametric models do not make strong assumptions about the 
                                \underlying data distribution. Instead, they aim to learn patterns directly from the 
                                data, without assuming a specific functional form.
