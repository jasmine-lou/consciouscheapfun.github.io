                        Artificial Intelligence (AI): a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines
                        and computer programs that can think and learn like humans. It enables computers to perform 
                        tasks such as recognizing images, understanding speech, and making decisions, helping us solve 
                        complex problems.

                        Machine Learning (ML): a subset of Artificial Intelligence that teaches computers how to learn 
                        and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. A computer will learn from examples 
                        and data, allowing it to recognize patterns, make decisions, and make predictions.
